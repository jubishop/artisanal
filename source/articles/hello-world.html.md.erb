Whew.  I first started blogging in the year 2000, back when it was this cool, new thing.  Now the concept is old and outdated.  And like most people who have ever tried, I've created and abandoned several blogs throughout the years.

I'm "old" now, and hopefully more capable of sticking to a plan until fruition.  This is the first time I've built my blog "from scratch".  I built my first blog when I was in highschool.  I used this cool new program called [Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html), lol.  Then I used "Blogspot" (which appears to be long gone), then [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), and finally [Medium](http://medium.com).  My blogging failures have basically followed the trends of the 21st century.

I find that trying to formulate my thoughts and share my coding accomplishments (or failures), is by far the best way to cement my understanding in my own brain.  As they often say, the best way to know something is to try and explain it to others.

I'm committed to accepting that these articles will be inherently flawed.  I'm not perfect, and I don't know everything.  And any article can always be changed.  So, here goes nothing!  I have a long list in Evernote of different ideas of things to write about.

I also hope, out of the small number of people that ever happen to visit these pages, I might occasionally hear from someone with a differing opinion or new information I didn't know about.  A nascent blogger can always dream.

I've already done what I'm always wont to do: spent far too much time on the code for this website rather than creating any content.  It's what makes me an engineer, instead of a writer.  *C'est la vie*.  Time to get started trying to write something useful (or at least interesting).  Cheers, and happy Labor Day!
